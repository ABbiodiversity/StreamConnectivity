# Stream Connectivity Indicator for Alberta

> Version 1.0 2022-04-19

## Introduction

The Alberta Environment and Parks (AEP), in partnership with the Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI), developed a stream connectivity indicator to help inform the environmental planning of Albertaâ€™s watersheds. The goals of this indicator are to:

- Quantify the degree of connectivity within our stream systems.
- Identify and monitor changes in anthropogenic barriers (i.e., culverts, dams, bridges) as they relate to biodiversity either directly or indirectly.
- Incorporate variation in the location and probability of movement through different types of barriers.
- Can be implemented at multiple spatial scales.
- Cost effective in monitoring and reporting.

For this indicator, we chose to use the Connectivity Status Index proposed by Diebel et al. (2014). This is a biological indicator developed to identify patterns of functional connectivity on the landscape. This index provides us with the flexibility to include measures such as habitat type, quality, and species dispersal limitations, while also incorporating variable resistance values to each barrier on the stream network.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the R code (**src/**) required for reproducing the results presented on GeoDiscover Alberta (https://geodiscover.alberta.ca/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/7025fe90840a4680b4011b7100c21644/html). The Stream Connectivity Indicator for Alberta is a geospatial product that presents the connectivity status of all HUC 8 watersheds in Alberta at four timesteps: 2010, 2014, 2016, and 2018. The base GIS layers used to calculate this indicator are not available due to their size and sensitivity. We have created a technical document describing the methodology of this indicator (https://open.alberta.ca/publications/stream-connectivity-indicator-for-alberta). For any questions regarding the scripts presented in this repository, GeoDiscover product, technical documentation, or about other applications of this indicator, please contact Brandon Allen (ABMI Applied Ecologist) at brandon.allen@ualberta.
